Course Objectives
This course studies France in the mid-19th century during two periods when the combined forces of political will, economic prosperity, and deeply-rooted beliefs in the value of art and architecture supported events that shaped the face of Paris as we know it today. As a country, France also had a wide-reaching impact around the globe, and events there shook up the art establishment in ways that continue to be admired and emulated to this day.

Our focus will be the years when one political leader ruled in France, beginning with the landmark election of 1848 that offered male French citizens “universal suffrage” for the first time. Within three years a bloody coup left France with an highly autocratic prince-president and then emperor for ruled for nearly two decades.

We will examine topics including: “Democracy and Autocracy;” “Power and Historical Objects;” “Racialized Bodies and Colonialism;” “Engaging with Nature;” “Artists and their Networks.” We will analyze how architecture and works of art in a wide range of forms – including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing and photography – are assigned meaningful roles in society, are used to influence public perception of people and events, and are significant vehicles for social change.

 

Course Learning Outcomes

1) Analyze visual works of art from mid-19th-century France within their social and historical context.

2) Evaluate the intersections of art and politics in mid-19th-century France and develop the ability to communicate their ongoing relevance.

3) Expand and refine skills in research, writing, oral presentation, and analysis of readings that demonstrate proficiency in critiquing sources and an ability to examine works of art in depth.

Textbooks, Materials & Fees
You will have weekly required readings, an article, chapter or section of a book, or excerpt of primary source.

I will not assign a reading during the week of Thanksgiving, nor the first week of November when your mid-term essay is due.

All readings will be available through the library’s e-resources and accessible through Avenue to Learn.

DETAILS OF ASSESSMENTS:
Participate and Engage with Course materials 10%

This course offers opportunities for you to develop intellectually and personally through both the content we will cover and how you relate the historical material to our contemporary context, within a global perspective.

To participate and engage with success: you focus on course material, with your mind and body, throughout class time; you arrive to our WebEx classroom environment in advance of the start time for each session; following any scheduled class pause, you re-engage at the designated time; you take notes during lectures, during question/answer periods, and when you watch your peers present their research; you contribute to class discussions when you are invited to do so, remaining considerate of the parameters of our time together and the need to ensure everyone has opportunities to contribute; you are an active participant and offer constructive responses to peer presentations through the appropriate forums; you manifest respect for the intellectual work and personal interests of others, demonstrate sensitivity, and remain open to any differences you perceive.

To benefit optimally from the course, I recommend that you keep up to date with recent and current events. I suggest you commit to reading headlines and some full articles in one or, when possible, two sources, ideally one Canadian newspaper and one non-Canadian publication. I am not prescribing particular sources and advocate that you to seek out reliable resources as you develop your ability to analyze the numerous and at times uncanny parallels between the past and the present. As a student registered at McMaster you have e-access to many reputable sources of news through our library. I encourage you to use them as you continue to cultivate yourself as a well-educated global citizen.

 

Explore and Respond to Resources 10%

I have designed this assignment so that you discover and learn about resources that you will find valuable throughout the semester.

Between our first and second class meetings on September 10 and 14, you will explore what resources you can find online that support your study of French art and politics between 1848 and 1870.

You should expect to spend several hours hunting down reliable sources. I suggest you explore those available through the library such as databases and journals and then look for websites related to museums, associations, and any open-access journal(s) that you connect with our course material. 

You will choose one of the resources you have found – perhaps the one you find most inspiring or engaging – and post it on ATL in the Explore and Respond to Resources Discussion Board. In addition to providing either a link or information on how to access the resource you highlight, you will write 150-250 words on why you recommend the source to others. You must complete your post on the Discussion Board no later than noon on Monday September 14.

Following class that day, you will return to the Discussion Board and explore the resources your peers have shared. You will choose one of the resources posted by a classmate and offer a response, 100-150 words in length, that outlines how and why the resource s.he found could be helpful to you and support your learning in the course. You must complete your response within 24 hours as the Discussion Board will close on Tuesday September 15 at 1:30 pm.

 

Analyze Required Readings 10%

Starting the first full week of classes (September 14-18), you will analyze one reading each week. You will complete your analysis prior to our sessions on Thursdays. The readings will be either an article, a chapter of a book, or an excerpt from a primary source.

As you complete each reading, you will produce handwritten or typed notes. Before class on Thursday, you will upload a scan or copy of your notes on the assigned reading to the designated dropbox on ATL. In the following week I will review your notes and mark them according to three categories: Complete, High Complete, or Unsatisfactory. If you repeatedly submit notes that are Unsatisfactory, you must recognize that will impact your overall grade. Your notes should outline the specific information you learned (facts and details) from each assigned reading. In addition to content, you will evaluate what s.he aimed to communicate and the extent to which each author achieved the goals of their research.

I am not assigning you a Required Reading for the week of Thanksgiving, nor for November 5, the Thursday session after you submit your Mid-term Essay.

 

Independent Research Project 15%

Each of you will select a different topic from a list of possible research subjects, that includes key historical events, people, and artistic techniques. You will be responsible for producing an Oral Presentation of your research, in the form of a 3-5 minute video that you will share with your peers through ATL. This video will include you teaching about your subject with an approach that is accessible and well-structured. You are welcome to activate your presentation in ways that are meaningful and support learning, such as analyzing relevant works of art.

You will submit to me a Written Report that includes a 200-300 word discussion of how you went about your research, and what your experience has been like doing this independent work. You will also include a bibliography that cites all of the sources you used to prepare your project (minimum 7 sources; maximum 1 page; single-spaced, 12-point Cambria font). You will structure your bibliography following the guidelines of the Chicago Style that I will post on Avenue to Learn.

Your Oral Presentation and Written Report will be due no less than 30 minutes before we meet for class on Monday October 19 (both due before noon). You will upload both to ATL: your video to the Oral Presentations Discussion Board and your report to the appropriate dropbox. For one week, October 19-26, you and your peers will have an opportunity to watch one another’s videos and are welcome to offer responses that focus on how one another’s research supports learning in the course. The Discussion Board will close at noon on Monday October 26.

 

Mid-term Essay 20%

Just over half way through the semester, you will write an essay that demonstrates your comprehension of the material we have covered in the first part of the course.

I will assign a reading, the same source, to everyone registered in the course. It will be either an article, a chapter or section of a book. I will also provide you with a written statement to help guide your analysis of the material. You will evaluate the source and apply what you have learned, through the material I have presented and your work on the required readings. You will submit your analysis as an essay that will be 7-8 pages in length (typed, double-spaced, 12-point Cambria font).

Your essay will make clear that you are able to investigate and assess the strength(s) and/or weakness(es) of the assigned source. You will demonstrate your in-depth understanding of the contents of our class by how you incorporate materials and make comparisons that support your evaluation. You will apply examples from among the works of art we have studied and you will include insights based on your work with the required readings you have read during the first part of the course.

I will assign the source for the mid-term essay at the end of class on Thursday October 29  and make it and the written statement available to you via Avenue to Learn immediately following class. Your essay will be due to the dropbox no less than 30 minutes before we meet for class on Monday November 2.

 

Lickity-Split Quiz on the Essentials 10%

On Monday November 30, at the beginning of class, you will take a quiz that I design to test your knowledge of key terms, people, techniques and events we have covered in our course, to date.

The quiz will consist of Fill-in-the-blank questions. You will need to be able to spell each word correctly and you will need to be able to cite multi-word phrases in entirety in order to receive the full mark that is possible for each answer, otherwise the best you will receive is a part of the maximum point possible for that blank.

To prepare yourself to do well on this quiz, I recommend that you review key terms, people, techniques and events regularly, meaning at least once each week. You could use cue cards or – whatever other techniques you like – to test the knowledge bank you are building throughout our course. Testing blocks of knowledge through review will help you to move information into your long-term memory, which is not only far more reliable during a quiz but also positions you to be more likely to retain the material in the future.

 

Final Essay 25%

After our final class session, you will write an essay that demonstrates your comprehension of the material we have covered during the semester, focusing particularly on the content of the course from November 5 to the last day of class.

I will assign up to two readings, the same for everyone registered in the course. They will be either articles, chapters or sections of a book, an excerpt of a primary source, or a combination thereof. I will also provide you with a written statement to help guide your analysis of the materials. You will evaluate the sources and apply what you have learned through the material I have presented and your work on the required readings. You will submit your analysis as an essay that will be 10-12 pages in length (typed, double-spaced, 12-point Cambria font).

Your essay will make clear that you are able to investigate and assess the strength(s) and/or weakness(es) of the assigned sources. You will demonstrate your in-depth understanding of the contents of our class by how you incorporate materials and make comparisons that support your evaluation. You will apply examples from among the works of art we have studied and you will include insights based on your work with the required readings assigned since you submitted the mid-term essay.

The Final Essay will be due on the date and time the Registrar’s Office schedules our class within the Final Examination Period. You will submit your essay to the appropriate dropbox on ATL within the first 15 minutes of that window of time. I will make the source(s) and the statement available to you after the final class session on December 7.

Please Note the Following Policies and Statements:
Academic Integrity

You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.

Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: "Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty"), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/university-policies-procedures-guidelines/

The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty:

plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained.
improper collaboration in group work.
copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.
Authenticity / Plagiarism Detection

Some courses may use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal authenticity and ownership of student submitted work. For courses using such software, students will be expected to submit their work electronically either directly to Turnitin.com or via Avenue to Learn (A2L) plagiarism detection (a service supported by Turnitin.com) so it can be checked for academic dishonesty.

Students who do not wish to submit their work through A2L and/or Turnitin.com must still submit an electronic and/or hardcopy to the instructor. No penalty will be assigned to a student who does not submit work to Turnitin.com or A2L. All submitted work is subject to normal verification that standards of academic integrity have been upheld (e.g., on-line search, other software, etc.). To see the Turnitin.com Policy, please go to www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity.


Courses with an On-Line Element

Some courses use on-line elements (e.g. e-mail, Avenue to Learn (A2L), LearnLink, web pages, capa, Moodle, ThinkingCap, etc.). Students should be aware that, when they access the electronic components of a course using these elements, private information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in the same course. The available information is dependent on the technology used. Continuation in a course that uses on-line elements will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with the course instructor.


Online Proctoring

Some courses may use online proctoring software for tests and exams. This software may require students to turn on their video camera, present identification, monitor and record their computer activities, and/or lockdown their browser during tests or exams. This software may be required to be installed before the exam begins.


Conduct Expectations

As a McMaster student, you have the right to experience, and the responsibility to demonstrate, respectful and dignified interactions within all of our living, learning and working communities. These expectations are described in the Code of Student Rights & Responsibilities (the "Code"). All students share the responsibility of maintaining a positive environment for the academic and personal growth of all McMaster community members, whether in person or online.

It is essential that students be mindful of their interactions online, as the Code remains in effect in virtual learning environments. The Code applies to any interactions that adversely affect, disrupt, or interfere with reasonable participation in University activities. Student disruptions or behaviours that interfere with university functions on online platforms (e.g. use of Avenue 2 Learn, WebEx or Zoom for delivery), will be taken very seriously and will be investigated. Outcomes may include restriction or removal of the involved students' access to these platforms.


Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who require academic accommodation must contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at 905-525-9140 ext. 28652 or sas@mcmaster.ca e-mail to make arrangements with a Program Coordinator. For further information, consult McMaster University’s Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities policy.


Email correspondence policy

It is the policy of the Faculty of Humanities that all email communication sent from students to instructors (including TAs), and from students to staff, must originate from each student’s own McMaster University email account. This policy protects confidentiality and confirms the identity of the student.  Instructors will delete emails that do not originate from a McMaster email account.


Modification of course outlines

The University reserves the right to change dates and/or deadlines etc. for any or all courses in the case of an emergency situation or labour disruption or civil unrest/disobedience, etc. If a modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the students will be given with an explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. Any significant changes should be made in consultation with the Department Chair.


Request for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work
McMaster Student Absence Form (MSAF)

In the event of an absence for medical or other reasons, students should review and follow the Academic Regulation in the Undergraduate Calendar "Requests for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work".


Academic Accommodation for Religious, Indigenous and Spiritual Observances (RISO)

Students requiring academic accommodation based on religious, indigenous or spiritual observances should follow the procedures set out in the RISO policy. Students should submit their request to their Faculty Office normally within 10 working days of the beginning of term in which they anticipate a need for accommodation or to the Registrar's Office prior to their examinations. Students should also contact their instructors as soon as possible to make alternative arrangements for classes, assignments, and tests.


Copyright and Recording

Students are advised that lectures, demonstrations, performances, and any other course material provided by an instructor include copyright protected works. The Copyright Act and copyright law protect every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including lectures by University instructors.

The recording of lectures, tutorials, or other methods of instruction may occur during a course. Recording may be done by either the instructor for the purpose of authorized distribution, or by a student for the purpose of personal study. Students should be aware that their voice and/or image may be recorded by others during the class. Please speak with the instructor if this is a concern for you.


Extreme Circumstances

The University reserves the right to change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances (e.g., severe weather, labour disruptions, etc.). Changes will be communicated through regular McMaster communication channels, such as McMaster Daily News, A2L and/or McMaster email.
