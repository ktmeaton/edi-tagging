Course Objectives
This course explores major trends and changes in Latin America from the Wars for Independence to the present. Through lectures, readings, and writing assignments we will explore the history of Latin American culture, politics, economics, and society. In this course, you will gain an appreciation of Latin America’s geographical diversity and rich cultural heritage as well as its formidable economic and political challenges. Because it is not feasible to survey the entire region within one academic term, we will sample selected countries, individuals, and events that illustrate the central themes of the modern period. The first half of the course explores the nineteenth century and will cover the aftermath of independence, the political struggle for power between conservatives and liberals, the rise of neocolonialism, and the cultural and social legacies of the colonial period, including the last years of slavery in Cuba and Brazil. The second half of the course covers topics since the beginning of the twentieth century such as populism, dependency, underdevelopment, guerrilla warfare, revolution, neoliberalism, and globalization.

This online course will be delivered through Avenue in an asynchronous format, which means that all the content can be accessed at any time through the weekly schedule on the Avenue Content menu. This class has no tutorials so weekly short discussion papers take their place. Quizzes and exams will be administered using Avenue’s “Quizzes” function. The quiz or exam will be offered over a 24-hour window on specific dates but with restricted time for completion. There will be at least two virtual Zoom sessions, one early in the term and one before the mid-term exam. These optional sessions will give students an opportunity to interact with the instructor and each other. Any changes to the course will be made in the announcements section of Avenue.

Discussion Papers:

The weekly discussion papers require you to briefly analyze one of the documents from Problems in Modern Latin American History. The exact document to be analyzed each week is identified on the weekly class schedule along with a suggested question to help you focus your analysis. Students who desire written feedback on their papers must submit them by the Friday deadline. See Rampolla, Pocket Guide, chapters 1-4, for advice on how to approach the writing of history papers. Consider also using Grammarly, a free grammar checker (www.grammarly.com), to correct some of your writing errors.

Quizzes:

Quizzes will be administered through Avenue’s quiz function under the Assessments tab. The quiz portal will be open on a specified date (October 21 and December 2) for 24 hours. Once you enter the portal you will be given 30 minutes to complete 30 multiple-choice questions. The first quiz will cover material from week 1 to week 6, while the second quiz will cover only material from week 7 to week 12.

Exams:

The midterm covers the first 6 weeks of course material, while the final exam covers only the last 6 weeks of course material. Both exams will be administered through Avenue’s quiz function. The midterm exam portal will open on October 28 for 24 hours. Once you enter the portal you will have 2.5 hours to answer 2 essay questions. The final exam will run the same way, except that the date and time of the final exam portal are to be determined by the registrar’s office.

Please Note the Following Policies and Statements:
Academic Integrity

You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.

Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: "Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty"), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/university-policies-procedures-guidelines/

The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty:

plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained.
improper collaboration in group work.
copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.
Authenticity / Plagiarism Detection

Some courses may use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal authenticity and ownership of student submitted work. For courses using such software, students will be expected to submit their work electronically either directly to Turnitin.com or via Avenue to Learn (A2L) plagiarism detection (a service supported by Turnitin.com) so it can be checked for academic dishonesty.

Students who do not wish to submit their work through A2L and/or Turnitin.com must still submit an electronic and/or hardcopy to the instructor. No penalty will be assigned to a student who does not submit work to Turnitin.com or A2L. All submitted work is subject to normal verification that standards of academic integrity have been upheld (e.g., on-line search, other software, etc.). To see the Turnitin.com Policy, please go to www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity.


Courses with an On-Line Element

Some courses use on-line elements (e.g. e-mail, Avenue to Learn (A2L), LearnLink, web pages, capa, Moodle, ThinkingCap, etc.). Students should be aware that, when they access the electronic components of a course using these elements, private information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in the same course. The available information is dependent on the technology used. Continuation in a course that uses on-line elements will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with the course instructor.


Online Proctoring

Some courses may use online proctoring software for tests and exams. This software may require students to turn on their video camera, present identification, monitor and record their computer activities, and/or lockdown their browser during tests or exams. This software may be required to be installed before the exam begins.


Conduct Expectations

As a McMaster student, you have the right to experience, and the responsibility to demonstrate, respectful and dignified interactions within all of our living, learning and working communities. These expectations are described in the Code of Student Rights & Responsibilities (the "Code"). All students share the responsibility of maintaining a positive environment for the academic and personal growth of all McMaster community members, whether in person or online.

It is essential that students be mindful of their interactions online, as the Code remains in effect in virtual learning environments. The Code applies to any interactions that adversely affect, disrupt, or interfere with reasonable participation in University activities. Student disruptions or behaviours that interfere with university functions on online platforms (e.g. use of Avenue 2 Learn, WebEx or Zoom for delivery), will be taken very seriously and will be investigated. Outcomes may include restriction or removal of the involved students' access to these platforms.


Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who require academic accommodation must contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at 905-525-9140 ext. 28652 or sas@mcmaster.ca e-mail to make arrangements with a Program Coordinator. For further information, consult McMaster University’s Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities policy.


Email correspondence policy

It is the policy of the Faculty of Humanities that all email communication sent from students to instructors (including TAs), and from students to staff, must originate from each student’s own McMaster University email account. This policy protects confidentiality and confirms the identity of the student.  Instructors will delete emails that do not originate from a McMaster email account.


Modification of course outlines

The University reserves the right to change dates and/or deadlines etc. for any or all courses in the case of an emergency situation or labour disruption or civil unrest/disobedience, etc. If a modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the students will be given with an explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. Any significant changes should be made in consultation with the Department Chair.


Request for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work
McMaster Student Absence Form (MSAF)

In the event of an absence for medical or other reasons, students should review and follow the Academic Regulation in the Undergraduate Calendar "Requests for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work".


Academic Accommodation for Religious, Indigenous and Spiritual Observances (RISO)

Students requiring academic accommodation based on religious, indigenous or spiritual observances should follow the procedures set out in the RISO policy. Students should submit their request to their Faculty Office normally within 10 working days of the beginning of term in which they anticipate a need for accommodation or to the Registrar's Office prior to their examinations. Students should also contact their instructors as soon as possible to make alternative arrangements for classes, assignments, and tests.


Copyright and Recording

Students are advised that lectures, demonstrations, performances, and any other course material provided by an instructor include copyright protected works. The Copyright Act and copyright law protect every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including lectures by University instructors.

The recording of lectures, tutorials, or other methods of instruction may occur during a course. Recording may be done by either the instructor for the purpose of authorized distribution, or by a student for the purpose of personal study. Students should be aware that their voice and/or image may be recorded by others during the class. Please speak with the instructor if this is a concern for you.


Extreme Circumstances

The University reserves the right to change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances (e.g., severe weather, labour disruptions, etc.). Changes will be communicated through regular McMaster communication channels, such as McMaster Daily News, A2L and/or McMaster email.
