Course Objectives
This course has two general aims. First, the direct ambition is to equip you – through lectures, readings, several books, and tutorials - to recognize leading antecedents of our contemporary world. Second, the less visible goal is to help you work at your individual skills in reading and writing. These foundation skills, essential for rewarding experiences at university and beyond, are stressed in course assignments. You will receive clear and constructive comments on your assignments.

Through the lectures and readings, the TAs and I aim to promote curiosity about many civilizations and to guide you in that pursuit by examining the history of empires. Empires have been commonplace and widespread. Lectures and readings define empires and explain the forces that assembled empires and brought them into violent or uneasy contact with one another, and into often destructive and fatal contact with many indigenous peoples. At first, the lectures will concentrate on Eurasia, but mid-way in the term they follow European sea powers as they sailed to Africa, America, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Sea-borne trade and sea-borne empires connected the continents. The many lectures on European empires can be regarded as Eurocentrism; that point is mentioned and debated in the lectures and tackled in tutorial readings (particularly the reading by John Darwin).

To manage a course that covers more than a millennium and a half, certain empires and organizing themes have been selected. I call attention to patterns as well as differences among empires as they dealt with borderlands, rivals, control of trade, diverse indigenous peoples, and leadership succession. The subject material encourages thinking about connections between past and present. I will explain (my interpretation) how the world became inter-connected between 1700 and 1900, partly through the actions of individuals and groups operating in empires. Several empires left their imprints on distant parts of the world through voluntary and forced Diasporas (emigration, indentured labour, Atlantic slavery and slave trade), the movement of religious beliefs and secular ideas, resource extraction, trade linkages, the control of chokepoints in trade, and the movement of plants, animals, and diseases. The legacies of violence, exploitation, and oppression are accented. Empires brought the world together even as they divided it.

The course will be presented as a Virtual course in the time slot assigned to the course.  In each class period I will present a live streamed segment accompanied at times by a video protion of the lecture.  You simply access the course by logging onto Echo360, the plantform used for the lectures.  It is a straight-forward process.  A full description is posted on the Avenue to Learn page for 1CC3.  Echo360 automatically records the lectures, so you can access them later. 

The tutotials will use a Webex platfom which does not require any software on your part; your assigned TAs will contact you with 'an invitation' shortly prior to the tutorial that you have been assigned to. A more detailed description of this process has been provided in the longer syllabus appearing in the Avenue to Learn page for 1CC3.    

Textbooks, Materials & Fees
You are responsible for securing access to the following required material. The University Store will have copies. There are many on-line services for new and used books. RedShelf and AbeBooks are examples.
You may have to place an order with the University Store for the courseware; it is usually printed on demand. You will not need it for assignments until mid-October.

Timothy Brook, Vermeer’s Hat.

Sunderland, Taming the Wild Field.

John Weaver, The Great Land Rush.

Courseware readings for 1CC3 (2020).

Method of Assessment
Major reports: 55% (25% and 30%)

For the first major assignment of 1000 words (25% of final mark) due on 7 October read Brook, Vermeer’s Hat. The topic is described below:

Some historians who are interested in doing more than outlining world history in detail have attempted to organize it around the concept of ‘movement.’ People moved; armies moved; trade goods were moved; ideas were moved. With these remarks in mind, write an account of the ‘movements’ that Brook explained were important for world history.

For the second assignment of 1500 words (30%) due on 11 November read Weaver, The Great Land Rush and Sunderland, Taming the Wild Field. The topic is described below:

Historical inquiries often involve investigating a category of event found in different locations and at different times. Such inquiries identify similarities and differences. One major category of event is the colonization of distant lands or borderlands by empires. Write an essay around the following assertion. “From roughly 1650 to 1900, colonizers’ (individuals and governments) in the British Empire, in what became the United States, and in Imperial Russia treated the first peoples who already lived on the land in similar ways and justified their actions in similar ways too.”

Five short assignments of 250-300 words: 20 % (4% each); tutorial participation: 10% based on TA assessments.  As mentioned earlier, tutorials will be conducted on the Webex platform; your assigned TAs will contact you with 'an invitation' shortly prior to the tutorial that you have been assigned to. A more detailed description of this process has been provided in the longer syllabus appearing in the Avenue to Learn page for this class.    

Final (0pen Book Taken Home) Exam: 15%.

Policy on Missed Work, Extensions, and Late Penalties

Please Note the Following Policies and Statements:
Academic Integrity

You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.

Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: "Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty"), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/university-policies-procedures-guidelines/

The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty:

plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained.
improper collaboration in group work.
copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.
Authenticity / Plagiarism Detection

Some courses may use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal authenticity and ownership of student submitted work. For courses using such software, students will be expected to submit their work electronically either directly to Turnitin.com or via Avenue to Learn (A2L) plagiarism detection (a service supported by Turnitin.com) so it can be checked for academic dishonesty.

Students who do not wish to submit their work through A2L and/or Turnitin.com must still submit an electronic and/or hardcopy to the instructor. No penalty will be assigned to a student who does not submit work to Turnitin.com or A2L. All submitted work is subject to normal verification that standards of academic integrity have been upheld (e.g., on-line search, other software, etc.). To see the Turnitin.com Policy, please go to www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity.


Courses with an On-Line Element

Some courses use on-line elements (e.g. e-mail, Avenue to Learn (A2L), LearnLink, web pages, capa, Moodle, ThinkingCap, etc.). Students should be aware that, when they access the electronic components of a course using these elements, private information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in the same course. The available information is dependent on the technology used. Continuation in a course that uses on-line elements will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with the course instructor.


Online Proctoring

Some courses may use online proctoring software for tests and exams. This software may require students to turn on their video camera, present identification, monitor and record their computer activities, and/or lockdown their browser during tests or exams. This software may be required to be installed before the exam begins.


Conduct Expectations

As a McMaster student, you have the right to experience, and the responsibility to demonstrate, respectful and dignified interactions within all of our living, learning and working communities. These expectations are described in the Code of Student Rights & Responsibilities (the "Code"). All students share the responsibility of maintaining a positive environment for the academic and personal growth of all McMaster community members, whether in person or online.

It is essential that students be mindful of their interactions online, as the Code remains in effect in virtual learning environments. The Code applies to any interactions that adversely affect, disrupt, or interfere with reasonable participation in University activities. Student disruptions or behaviours that interfere with university functions on online platforms (e.g. use of Avenue 2 Learn, WebEx or Zoom for delivery), will be taken very seriously and will be investigated. Outcomes may include restriction or removal of the involved students' access to these platforms.


Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who require academic accommodation must contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at 905-525-9140 ext. 28652 or sas@mcmaster.ca e-mail to make arrangements with a Program Coordinator. For further information, consult McMaster University’s Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities policy.


Email correspondence policy

It is the policy of the Faculty of Humanities that all email communication sent from students to instructors (including TAs), and from students to staff, must originate from each student’s own McMaster University email account. This policy protects confidentiality and confirms the identity of the student.  Instructors will delete emails that do not originate from a McMaster email account.


Modification of course outlines

The University reserves the right to change dates and/or deadlines etc. for any or all courses in the case of an emergency situation or labour disruption or civil unrest/disobedience, etc. If a modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the students will be given with an explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. Any significant changes should be made in consultation with the Department Chair.


Request for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work
McMaster Student Absence Form (MSAF)

In the event of an absence for medical or other reasons, students should review and follow the Academic Regulation in the Undergraduate Calendar "Requests for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work".


Academic Accommodation for Religious, Indigenous and Spiritual Observances (RISO)

Students requiring academic accommodation based on religious, indigenous or spiritual observances should follow the procedures set out in the RISO policy. Students should submit their request to their Faculty Office normally within 10 working days of the beginning of term in which they anticipate a need for accommodation or to the Registrar's Office prior to their examinations. Students should also contact their instructors as soon as possible to make alternative arrangements for classes, assignments, and tests.


Copyright and Recording

Students are advised that lectures, demonstrations, performances, and any other course material provided by an instructor include copyright protected works. The Copyright Act and copyright law protect every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including lectures by University instructors.

The recording of lectures, tutorials, or other methods of instruction may occur during a course. Recording may be done by either the instructor for the purpose of authorized distribution, or by a student for the purpose of personal study. Students should be aware that their voice and/or image may be recorded by others during the class. Please speak with the instructor if this is a concern for you.


Extreme Circumstances

The University reserves the right to change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances (e.g., severe weather, labour disruptions, etc.). Changes will be communicated through regular McMaster communication channels, such as McMaster Daily News, A2L and/or McMaster email.

2. Classes on 14-16 September: “Eurocentric Perspectives and Organizing Concepts.” These lectures will cover major questions that resurface throughout this course: 1) how can we explain the appearance that European countries as paramount imperial powers between roughly 1500 and 1900? 2) What is an empire; what is a colony? 3) What are the fundamental challenges that empires in most ages and regions have confronted and how did rulers attempt to solve them? 4) What are the legacies of empires in terms of today's global connections, conflicts, and racism.

3. Classes on 21-23 September: “Control, Trade, and Plunder:” The Foundations of a Post-Roman-Empire Europe: 500-1000 CE: Lectures this week introduce Eurasia as a heartland of empires, propose the importance of “a continental axis,” and illustrate these concepts with references to the Byzantine Empire and, to a limited extent, the Vikings.

4. Class on September 28: The Arab-Islamic Expansion, the Mediterranean, and Eurasian Connections, 700-1200 CE. This lecture focuses on explanations for the expansion and the cultural and economic influences of this diffusion that extended from ‘China’ in the East to ‘Spain’ in the West.

MID-TERM RECESS, 12-18 OCTOBER

6. Classes on 19-21 October: “The Clashes of Titans:” A Summary of a Complicated Age of Trade, Diplomacy, and Warfare, 1300-1550 CE. These lectures look at the clash of empires in and around the Mediterranean. We look at trade, alliances, and betrayal with respect to Venice and Genoa; the Islamic World and Ottoman Empire; the formation of the Hapsburg Empire.

7. Classes on 26-28 October. “The Re-conquest [Reconquista]:” Footloose Warriors Seize Empires in the So-called New World, 1500-1600 CE. This week we return to a question that opened this course.

8. Classes on 26-28 October: “The Industrious Revolution:” the Dutch, the Roots of Capitalism, and a Company Empire, 1600-1700 CE. The lectures will consider the rise of Amsterdam, the reach and force of the Dutch East India Company, the rise of capitalism, and London’s adoption of Dutch practices.

9. Classes 2-4 November: “The Centre of the World:” China and the Needham Question, 1000-1750 CE. Joseph Needham (1900-1992) was an English scientist who wrote Science and Civilization in China: a multi-volume history. Some of it was based on The Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times, a work of nearly 6000 volumes in modern edition commissioned by an early Qing emperor in 1700 and intended to be the sum of all Chinese knowledge. Needham’s work leaves us with the question, why didn’t China establish an overseas empire?
