Course Description: We cannot escape science and technology’s ubiquity or their importance to our everyday lives. We live in a world dominated by science and technology. As a result, it behooves us to better understand our historical relationship with these social structures. History 2EE3 serves as an introductory survey of the histories of science and technology. It will examine how science and technology have shaped human history—and how society and culture have shaped the production and consumption of science and technology over time.

 

This online course traces the major social and cultural themes in the histories of science and technology using a global perspective, following the transfer of knowledge and machines over time and between cultures. Students will not be expected to have (or, indeed, should not expect to acquire) scientific expertise beyond a rather basic level. Some background in science or engineering may, of course, prove valuable (and interesting), but the focus of this course is primarily intent on considering the communities of knowledge and technology that have evolved since Ancient times, not the particularities of will concentrate on science and technology’s influences on societies and social influences on science and technology through time and space. As a result, students will be challenged to think about the world in unorthodox patterns and to try to piece together comparative histories through themes and relationships that might serve as tools for evaluating the manner in which science and technology have played a critical role in shaping the human condition.

 

Course Objectives: “Science & Technology in World History” contains a series of learning outcomes.

Introduction to the histories of science & technology The course is primarily an introductory survey of science and technology’s place in world history. Students will be explore a variety of themes pertaining to knowledge and machines over time and place.

Lecture Quizzes: Each substantive lecture will conclude with some multiple choice questions designed to demonstrate comprehension of course content. These must be completed by the end of the week that follows the week during which the lecture is released. See the course schedule below. For example, lecture quizzes for “The Greek Miracle” and “Roman Planning” must be submitted by 23.59 on 23 September. Note the week’s lag between lecture viewing and quiz deadline.

 

Online Participation: Remote learning introduces a series of novel opportunities and challenges for university teaching and learning. First and foremost, I miss the prospect of meeting you in class and interacting with you face-to-face. It is often through interruptions, questions, and tangents in the classroom that real learning takes place. At the same time, I appreciate the flexibility in learning, time management, and content consumption afforded by the asynchronous format. Students can work on HIST 2EE3 at their own pace, on their own schedules, and during the time of day that suits them best. There is a danger, of course, that students will feel somewhat ostracized from the course, that it might feel like a personal labour rather than a community learning adventure. To address that problem, I have devoted 10% of the overall grade to online participation, but I want to stress that students can navigate this portion of their grade in the manner that suits them best. A series of non-required workshops/seminars will be scheduled over the course of the semester to discuss readings and course themes (look for them under the Schedules heading on Avenue). These will be set at fixed times for student drop-in. In addition, if students prefer not to participate in live discussions, or the times conflict with other commitments, they are invited to engage with each other over pre-arranged questions on Avenue discussion boards, and initiate their own conversations on course-related topics. Of course, students are welcome to participate across both platforms.

 

More than an objective evaluation of quality or quantity, I read participation as a suggestion of student investment in the course and in the spirit of learning. Quality and regularity of contributions matter, of course, but I am especially keen on fostering student buy-in as a means of their exploring what matters most to them as I help to facilitate their reaching their learning goals. The online participation grade will be split over two assessments, before and after the midterm recess (and weighted according to the number of weeks in the assessment). The premise is to give students a sense of their standing at roughly the midway point in the course.

 

Mind Map Note-taking: Over the course of the semester, students will submit five mind maps summarizing an article each from the course readings (not from the textbook). Of these, the top four will count toward the final grade. As with the lecture quizzes, please note the rolling soft deadline. Further instructions on expectation will be provided at the beginning of the semester.

 

Podcast Reading Responses: Where the mind maps are designed to help students develop their close reading and note-taking, the podcast reading responses provide them with an opportunity to develop their comprehension through analysis. Students will submit two podcasts over the course of the semester in response to articles from the syllabus (not the textbook). No external research is required—or encouraged. The podcasts should be no more than five minutes long, and they should adhere to standard essay writing expectations, containing an introduction, a thesis statement, a series of supporting arguments, and a conclusion. For the sake of organization, podcasts should probably be read. While style, elocution, and sound quality (so long as we can hear/understand you) will not count against you, students are encouraged to think about being lively in their presentation. Creative and ambitious students are invited to play with the medium and use it to their benefit.

 

The exercise—podcasting rather than writing—aims to serve various purposes:

it challenges students to approach their work through a novel lens;
it means to help students work toward greater clarity and focus in their communication;
it introduces students to new media and how to use them effectively.
For these reasons, I will not substitute this assignment for written work. Students are required to learn the technical skills necessary to produce the podcast. Technophobia is a poor excuse in a course on the history of science and technology.

 

Periodic Table of Elements Reflection Essay: Primo Levi’s name is not one that regularly appears in the history of science. He is best remembered for his powerful and stark memoirs of his experiences during the Holocaust, but his collection of short stories in this volume provide HIST 2EE3 with a rich opportunity to reflect on science, history, and society through the lens of a literary chemist. As a rule, I do not like to assign a question for student reflection essays, but in this case, I would instruct you to address the following: what is the relationship between science and society, using Primo Levi’s Periodic Table of Elements as a lens? Essays should be no more than 1000 words and should try to engage with at least three distinct stories in Levi’s book.

 

Film Review Essay: One of the driving themes in HIST 2EE3 is the manner in which science and technology are central features of everyday life and culture. To highlight this, students will watch and review a film of their choosing, and reflect on the roles played by science and technology. Essays should be no more than 1000 words. They should provide a brief summary of the film and the ways in which science and technology are portrayed.

 

On Effective Writing & Communication:

Succinct communication is a difficult skill to master (look how long this syllabus is!). By developing a few assignments around close reading and note-taking, HIST 2EE3 hopes to help students identify the key questions and arguments in each essay under examination—and in the same vein, work to hone in on the heart of their own ideas. These short assignments should be written/spoken in formal essay format, with an introduction and thesis statement, a body that seeks to support and demonstrate your argument, and a conclusion that brings closure to your essay. Brevity and efficiency are key. Students should avoid summarizing the articles and concentrate instead on engaging in analysis that links the essays to the themes of this course.

 

Avoid tackling themes that are too big to cover within the confines of these short papers. Papers that try to do too much tend to be vague and lack substance and/or supporting evidence. These tendencies will be reflected in students receiving a lower grade. Be sure to ground analysis in the articles and their relationship to the course and its themes.

 

Since effective writing and communication skills are essential in history and most all jobs you may have after graduation, the short writing assignments and podcasts will require careful attention to style and clarity, as well as the quality of your analytical work. Though short, I expect all assignments to be communicated in coherent English. Spelling, grammar, and originality all “count.” Formal academic style and conventions should be used (no point form; contractions; colloquialisms; slang, etc.). For students who are concerned about writing mechanics or are unclear on how to present an effective thesis statement, I can recommend Leslie E. Casson’s A Writer’s Handbook, which is concise, accessible, inexpensive, and widely available. When citing authorities—ie. the essay under review—a parenthetical page number will suffice. Students should refrain from using outside sources in these short assignments; the primary aim is to engage with the essay in question.

 

If you have difficulty with any of the assignments, speak with your teaching assistant before the assignment is due.

 

Late Assignment Policy: Deadlines are firm. I am willing to provide 3-day or 10-day extensions on an individual basis, and only if students have indicated a need for extra time before the deadline. Late assignments will be graded without comment.

 

Because computers and printers and bandwidth connections invariably tend to crash at exactly the point when assignments are due, students are strongly encouraged to avoid waiting until the last minute. Technology glitches do not constitute a satisfactory excuse for late submission, especially in a course that trains its lens on science and technology. Plan ahead. Since the syllabus and course schedule are available to students in advance, I recommend that you begin readings and writings early in order to avoid any untimely illnesses or other misadventures.

 

I intend to make every effort to ensure that student work is graded in a fair and timely manner, and that students receive the kind of feedback on their work that justifies the grade assigned and helps them to understand how to improve for the next assignment. Every now and then, something slips through the cracks, and I am reminded that my near-infinite wisdom is fallible. If a student should disagree with a grade, they should petition for a change grade in an e-mail to their teaching assistant. Students should reflect on the comments and feedback they received on the assignment, indicating that they understand the justification for the evaluation received, before suggesting why they disagree with the grade they received. No appeals will be accepted within 24 hours of the assignment being returned. Similarly, appeals have a two-week deadline after the assignment has been returned.

 

Every new course begins with the optimistic sense that it will go smoothly. Unfortunately, life, work, health, distractions can get in the way all too frequently. I am committed to helping students to realize their learning and accreditation goals, inside class and outside of it. In lieu of regular office hours in these difficult conditions, I am available over e-mail and more than happy to schedule a virtual meeting.

 

I encourage students to take advantage of my virtual office hours to ask questions, to use me as a sounding board for assignment ideas, and to look for ways to catch up if they have fallen behind. However, there are limitations to what is and what is not realistic in trying to catch up. In order to entertain working with students to develop strategies for catching up after 20 November 2020, students will need to have completed a minimum of 50% of the work assigned by that point in time. I impose this as a deadline, because my courses typically stress process over results. The spirit of the course (and of learning in general) demands room and time for growth, which is not possible in frantic make-up work. At the same time, life does happen. If students cannot meet these requirements, I am more than happy to work with them and with their faculty advising office to find alternative options.

 

HIST 2EE3 also works on a firm policy that no bonus work for credit will be offered. Students should endeavour to do the best work they can from the beginning of the semester, and to turn to me or the course’s teaching assistants for help.

 

E-mail Communication: It is the policy of the Faculty of Humanities that all e-mail communication between students and instructors (including TAs), and from students to staff, must originate from their official McMaster University e-mail accounts. This policy protects the confidentiality and sensitivity of information and confirms the identities of both the student and instructor. History Department instructors will delete messages that do not originate from McMaster e-mail accounts.

 

Note, too, that I mean to keep fairly strict e-mail hours. Do not expect a reply to your e-mail between 20.00 and 9.00. And do not expect to receive an e-mail reply on weekends. Which is to say: if you have a pressing question or concern, do not leave it until 21.00 on Friday evening to send me a message. I endeavour to reply to e-mails promptly—especially those that are time sensitive—but I apologize in advance if it takes more than a couple of days to reply.

 

Modifications to Course Outline: The instructor and university reserve the right to modify elements of the course during term. The university may change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances. If either type of modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the students will be given with explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. It is the responsibility of the student to check their McMaster e-mail and course websites weekly during the term and to note any changes.

 

 

 

Please Note the Following Policies and Statements:
Academic Integrity

You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.

Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: "Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty"), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/university-policies-procedures-guidelines/

The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty:

plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained.
improper collaboration in group work.
copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.
Authenticity / Plagiarism Detection

Some courses may use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal authenticity and ownership of student submitted work. For courses using such software, students will be expected to submit their work electronically either directly to Turnitin.com or via Avenue to Learn (A2L) plagiarism detection (a service supported by Turnitin.com) so it can be checked for academic dishonesty.

Students who do not wish to submit their work through A2L and/or Turnitin.com must still submit an electronic and/or hardcopy to the instructor. No penalty will be assigned to a student who does not submit work to Turnitin.com or A2L. All submitted work is subject to normal verification that standards of academic integrity have been upheld (e.g., on-line search, other software, etc.). To see the Turnitin.com Policy, please go to www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity.


Courses with an On-Line Element

Some courses use on-line elements (e.g. e-mail, Avenue to Learn (A2L), LearnLink, web pages, capa, Moodle, ThinkingCap, etc.). Students should be aware that, when they access the electronic components of a course using these elements, private information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in the same course. The available information is dependent on the technology used. Continuation in a course that uses on-line elements will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with the course instructor.


Online Proctoring

Some courses may use online proctoring software for tests and exams. This software may require students to turn on their video camera, present identification, monitor and record their computer activities, and/or lockdown their browser during tests or exams. This software may be required to be installed before the exam begins.


Conduct Expectations

As a McMaster student, you have the right to experience, and the responsibility to demonstrate, respectful and dignified interactions within all of our living, learning and working communities. These expectations are described in the Code of Student Rights & Responsibilities (the "Code"). All students share the responsibility of maintaining a positive environment for the academic and personal growth of all McMaster community members, whether in person or online.

It is essential that students be mindful of their interactions online, as the Code remains in effect in virtual learning environments. The Code applies to any interactions that adversely affect, disrupt, or interfere with reasonable participation in University activities. Student disruptions or behaviours that interfere with university functions on online platforms (e.g. use of Avenue 2 Learn, WebEx or Zoom for delivery), will be taken very seriously and will be investigated. Outcomes may include restriction or removal of the involved students' access to these platforms.


Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who require academic accommodation must contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at 905-525-9140 ext. 28652 or sas@mcmaster.ca e-mail to make arrangements with a Program Coordinator. For further information, consult McMaster University’s Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities policy.


Email correspondence policy

It is the policy of the Faculty of Humanities that all email communication sent from students to instructors (including TAs), and from students to staff, must originate from each student’s own McMaster University email account. This policy protects confidentiality and confirms the identity of the student.  Instructors will delete emails that do not originate from a McMaster email account.


Modification of course outlines

The University reserves the right to change dates and/or deadlines etc. for any or all courses in the case of an emergency situation or labour disruption or civil unrest/disobedience, etc. If a modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the students will be given with an explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. Any significant changes should be made in consultation with the Department Chair.


Request for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work
McMaster Student Absence Form (MSAF)

In the event of an absence for medical or other reasons, students should review and follow the Academic Regulation in the Undergraduate Calendar "Requests for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work".


Academic Accommodation for Religious, Indigenous and Spiritual Observances (RISO)

Students requiring academic accommodation based on religious, indigenous or spiritual observances should follow the procedures set out in the RISO policy. Students should submit their request to their Faculty Office normally within 10 working days of the beginning of term in which they anticipate a need for accommodation or to the Registrar's Office prior to their examinations. Students should also contact their instructors as soon as possible to make alternative arrangements for classes, assignments, and tests.


Copyright and Recording

Students are advised that lectures, demonstrations, performances, and any other course material provided by an instructor include copyright protected works. The Copyright Act and copyright law protect every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including lectures by University instructors.

The recording of lectures, tutorials, or other methods of instruction may occur during a course. Recording may be done by either the instructor for the purpose of authorized distribution, or by a student for the purpose of personal study. Students should be aware that their voice and/or image may be recorded by others during the class. Please speak with the instructor if this is a concern for you.


Extreme Circumstances

The University reserves the right to change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances (e.g., severe weather, labour disruptions, etc.). Changes will be communicated through regular McMaster communication channels, such as McMaster Daily News, A2L and/or McMaster email.
