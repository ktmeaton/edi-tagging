What is this history course about and what will I learn?

What does it mean to approach contemporary issues from a historical perspective?   History courses often move forward in time, from the past towards the present.  Instead, we will start with a five contemporary challenges, and consider to what extent and in what ways history may help us better understand and navigate them.  Although these challenges are global, our focus generally will be on these issues as they manifest in Canada and the United States.

This year, we will explore five major challenges:

Unit 1:  Pandemic Societies 

Unit 2:  Indigenous Activism and Truth and Reconciliation  

Unit 3:  Populist Politics and Privilege

Unit 4:  Racial Injustice and Antiracist Resistance

Unit 5: Climate and Energy Crises                                

What does it mean to think like a historian?  You will have an opportunity to think about how historians work, by using the kinds of documentary evidence upon which historians rely, by analyzing the way historians construct arguments, by seeing how historians relate their work to the work of other historians, and by examining differing historical viewpoints. You will have an opportunity to work like a historian, by reconstructing events and constructing historical explanations using documentary evidence and the work of other historians.

What does it mean to communicate like a historian? Historians and other university scholars share the fruits of their research by writing essays.  Through reading and exercises, you will enhance your academic research and essay-writing abilities. These skills will enhance your performance in future university courses; of course, I hope some of them will be history courses!

Textbooks, Materials & Fees
 

This course is being offered in virtual (also known as synchronous) and online (also known as asynchronous) formats.

Twice a week the class will meet virtually according to the schedule set out in your timetables by the registrar. These class sessions will be delivered using the platform WebEx, which will be made accessible through a link on Avenue to Learn.  These sessions will involve a mix of discussion formats.  An agenda and format of each session will be available at least two weeks ahead on Avenue to Learn, as will links to electronic version of all readings and any other details. 

There will be one online session most weeks, which will be available on Avenue to Learn.  Each asynchronous session, including agenda, instructions, links to electronic versions of all readings, and other materials, will become available Thursday at 8:00 am and will close the following Monday at 4:00 pm.

The course outline details which sessions are virtual and which are online.

Policy on Missed Work, Extensions, and Late Penalties
Late Penalties: Where the late penalty is not identified with the assignment description, late assignments will be penalized with a deduction of 5% per day (weekends count as one day). Extensions will only be granted if you ensure that your instructor receives the appropriate documentation from the Humanities office. Poor work planning (eg. "I have a midterm in another course this week") is not grounds for an extension. No assignments can be accepted beyond the 23 December, unless you obtain deferred standing.  All assignments in this course will be submitted electronically, unless otherwise authorized by the instuctor.

Notes and Backup: Because assignments sometimes get lost, and because questions of authorship occasionally arise, you must keep the research notes and all the rough drafts for all written work, even after it has been marked and returned. Be sure to create electronic backup files and store them in multiple places.
 

Please Note the Following Policies and Statements:
Academic Integrity

You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity. It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic dishonesty.

Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript (notation reads: "Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty"), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, located at https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/university-policies-procedures-guidelines/

The following illustrates only three forms of academic dishonesty:

plagiarism, e.g. the submission of work that is not one’s own or for which other credit has been obtained.
improper collaboration in group work.
copying or using unauthorized aids in tests and examinations.
Authenticity / Plagiarism Detection

Some courses may use a web-based service (Turnitin.com) to reveal authenticity and ownership of student submitted work. For courses using such software, students will be expected to submit their work electronically either directly to Turnitin.com or via Avenue to Learn (A2L) plagiarism detection (a service supported by Turnitin.com) so it can be checked for academic dishonesty.

Students who do not wish to submit their work through A2L and/or Turnitin.com must still submit an electronic and/or hardcopy to the instructor. No penalty will be assigned to a student who does not submit work to Turnitin.com or A2L. All submitted work is subject to normal verification that standards of academic integrity have been upheld (e.g., on-line search, other software, etc.). To see the Turnitin.com Policy, please go to www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity.


Courses with an On-Line Element

Some courses use on-line elements (e.g. e-mail, Avenue to Learn (A2L), LearnLink, web pages, capa, Moodle, ThinkingCap, etc.). Students should be aware that, when they access the electronic components of a course using these elements, private information such as first and last names, user names for the McMaster e-mail accounts, and program affiliation may become apparent to all other students in the same course. The available information is dependent on the technology used. Continuation in a course that uses on-line elements will be deemed consent to this disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns about such disclosure please discuss this with the course instructor.


Online Proctoring

Some courses may use online proctoring software for tests and exams. This software may require students to turn on their video camera, present identification, monitor and record their computer activities, and/or lockdown their browser during tests or exams. This software may be required to be installed before the exam begins.


Conduct Expectations

As a McMaster student, you have the right to experience, and the responsibility to demonstrate, respectful and dignified interactions within all of our living, learning and working communities. These expectations are described in the Code of Student Rights & Responsibilities (the "Code"). All students share the responsibility of maintaining a positive environment for the academic and personal growth of all McMaster community members, whether in person or online.

It is essential that students be mindful of their interactions online, as the Code remains in effect in virtual learning environments. The Code applies to any interactions that adversely affect, disrupt, or interfere with reasonable participation in University activities. Student disruptions or behaviours that interfere with university functions on online platforms (e.g. use of Avenue 2 Learn, WebEx or Zoom for delivery), will be taken very seriously and will be investigated. Outcomes may include restriction or removal of the involved students' access to these platforms.


Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who require academic accommodation must contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) at 905-525-9140 ext. 28652 or sas@mcmaster.ca e-mail to make arrangements with a Program Coordinator. For further information, consult McMaster University’s Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities policy.


Email correspondence policy

It is the policy of the Faculty of Humanities that all email communication sent from students to instructors (including TAs), and from students to staff, must originate from each student’s own McMaster University email account. This policy protects confidentiality and confirms the identity of the student.  Instructors will delete emails that do not originate from a McMaster email account.


Modification of course outlines

The University reserves the right to change dates and/or deadlines etc. for any or all courses in the case of an emergency situation or labour disruption or civil unrest/disobedience, etc. If a modification becomes necessary, reasonable notice and communication with the students will be given with an explanation and the opportunity to comment on changes. Any significant changes should be made in consultation with the Department Chair.


Request for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work
McMaster Student Absence Form (MSAF)

In the event of an absence for medical or other reasons, students should review and follow the Academic Regulation in the Undergraduate Calendar "Requests for Relief for Missed Academic Term Work".


Academic Accommodation for Religious, Indigenous and Spiritual Observances (RISO)

Students requiring academic accommodation based on religious, indigenous or spiritual observances should follow the procedures set out in the RISO policy. Students should submit their request to their Faculty Office normally within 10 working days of the beginning of term in which they anticipate a need for accommodation or to the Registrar's Office prior to their examinations. Students should also contact their instructors as soon as possible to make alternative arrangements for classes, assignments, and tests.


Copyright and Recording

Students are advised that lectures, demonstrations, performances, and any other course material provided by an instructor include copyright protected works. The Copyright Act and copyright law protect every original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including lectures by University instructors.

The recording of lectures, tutorials, or other methods of instruction may occur during a course. Recording may be done by either the instructor for the purpose of authorized distribution, or by a student for the purpose of personal study. Students should be aware that their voice and/or image may be recorded by others during the class. Please speak with the instructor if this is a concern for you.


Extreme Circumstances

The University reserves the right to change the dates and deadlines for any or all courses in extreme circumstances (e.g., severe weather, labour disruptions, etc.). Changes will be communicated through regular McMaster communication channels, such as McMaster Daily News, A2L and/or McMaster email.
